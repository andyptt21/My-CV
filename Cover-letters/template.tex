I am very excited to apply to your vacant Bioinformatics Scientist
position at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. I was intrigued to see a call
for an individual well-versed in multiomic analysis as well as
biostatistics. I believe that my strong background in metabolomics,
transcriptomics and genomics will make me an excellent candidate.

My postbaccalaureate experience at the NIH as well as my graduate
career at Ohio State/NIH has given me a wide breadth of bioinformatic
experience that has allowed me to be a productive research associate
at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), as
evidenced by my strong publication record. This experience will give
me the adaptability to succeed in a new setting such as the Metabolism
and Muscle group.

One of my main passion projects at NCATS has been the development of
novel pathway enrichment methods for metabolite data, based on prior
knowledge networks. This was a project I concieved of independently,
and has already been featured in one published work from the lab. I am
confident in my ability to leverage my mathematical training to
continue to develop new statistical workflows in whatever context it
is needed.

Thank you for the opportunity to apply. I am looking forward to
potentially learning more about the Bioinformatics Scientist position
and life at Regeneron. I'm a productive and goal-oriented individual,
and I look forward to transitioning my talents to the biomedical
research industry, where Regeneron is a leader.
